# solarHeaterSimulation

Solar Heater Simulation made in Javascript with help of Three.js for visualization.

This is for 2-strata water tank and some of the variables which define the nature, time and behaviour of physical process like irradiance, flow rate, and material loss cofficient are kept as consatant in code.

In code, each frame update is update the state status of every next 500 second interval. 

## I have not added gitignore in this project because i wanted all of the project in github repo that won't require me to install package.

if you want you can add .gitignore and my suggestion is to put put nodemodules route inside gitignore

/node_modules
/build

## to run this project:


to install/update dependencies if you need ( i have pushed node modules as well)

```
npm install
```

to run project locally 
```
npm run dev
```

to build project
```
npm run build
```

I am using webpack for hosting and building !!!
