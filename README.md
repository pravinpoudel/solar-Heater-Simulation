# solarHeaterSimulation

Solar Heater Simulation made in Javascript with help of Three.js for visualization.

This is for 2-strata water tank and some of the variables which define the nature, time and behaviour of physical process like irradiance, flow rate, and material loss cofficient are kept as consatant in code.

In code, each frame update is update the state status of every next 500 second interval.
